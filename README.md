# instagram-bootstrap
## Brief
* Rebuild Instagram Homepage using bootstrap
* Practice proper Git process
* Pull request by Monday Morning

## Process
>Using bootstrap from the beginning made the process a lot easier, especially in the css file. All the links work besides the sign in button and all the form fields operate like they should.

## Difficulties
>I had trouble adding the Facebook icon to the button and also formatting some of the boxes. I also couldn't figure out how to make the background of the Instagram logo transparent.

## Successes
>I a pleased with the form fields and the first box, that was made very easily and quickly. I also made the site responsive mostly like the real site.

## The Code
>The code is written using bootstrap and fontawesome links. It is split in to 4 rows each row containing at least 1 column. All boxes in the grid are positioned using the absolute term.
